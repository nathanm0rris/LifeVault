Meals x 2

Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
2 large garlic cloves, crushed
¼ tsp chilli flakes
2 rosemary sprigs, leaves finely chopped
2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes
1 tbsp brown sugar
6 pork sausages
150ml whole milk
1 lemon, zested
350g rigatoni pasta
grated parmesan and ½ small bunch parsley, leaves roughly chopped, to serve

Method:
STEP 1
Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Fry the onion with a pinch of salt for 7 mins. Add the garlic, chilli and rosemary, and cook for 1 min more. Tip in the tomatoes and sugar, and simmer for 20 mins.

STEP 2
Heat the remaining oil in a medium frying pan over a medium heat. Squeeze the sausagemeat from the skins and fry, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, for 5-7 mins until golden. Add to the sauce with the milk and lemon zest, then simmer for a further 5 mins. To freeze, leave to cool completely and transfer to large freezerproof bags.

STEP 3
Cook the pasta following pack instructions. Drain and toss with the sauce. Scatter over the parmesan and parsley leaves to serve.
