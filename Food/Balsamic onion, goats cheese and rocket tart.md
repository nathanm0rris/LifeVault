Meals x 3

Ingredients:
1 x 125g log vegetarian soft goats cheese
3 tbsp creme fraiche
1 x sheet (about 320g) ready-rolled puff pastry
1 x 60g bag rocket
2 tbsp pine nuts, toasted (optional)
FOR THE BALSAMIC ONION CHUTNEY
2 tsp olive oil
2 red onions, finely sliced
1 tsp thyme leaves
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp caster sugar

Method:
GET AHEAD
Make the onion chutney up to 4-5 days before and store in the fridge. Leftovers are great in sandwiches, cheese toasties or with pate.
For the balsamic onion chutney, heat the oil in a large frying pan on a low heat and gently fry the onions and thyme for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Add 150ml water, turn up the heat slightly and sweat the onions until they are really soft and the water has evaporated, about 20-30 minutes. Stir in the balsamic and sugar, lower the heat again, and cook until sticky and caramelised, about 5-10 minutes, stirring often. Leave to cool.
Heat the oven to 220°C, fan 200°C, gas 7. Mash the goats’ cheese and creme fraiche together in a bowl with a fork until smooth, and season well.
Unroll the puff pastry onto a lined baking sheet and score a border 1cm in from the edge. Spread the cheese mixture within the border, then spoon 4 tbsp onion chutney over the top. Cook for 20-25 minutes in the oven until the pastry is puffed up, and the cheese is lightly golden. Leave to stand for 5 minutes, then scatter with rocket and pine nuts, if using, to serve.
