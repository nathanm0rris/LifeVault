Meals x 1

Ingredients:

1 garlic clove , finely sliced
1 heaped tbsp red pepper salsa (we used Gran Luchito) or 1/4-1/2 red pepper, chopped
1 medium egg
1 tbsp chopped coriander and pitta bread, to serve

Method:
STEP 1
Brush a microwave bowl or dish with a little of the oil. Stir the passata, garlic and salsa together and season well. Tip into the bowl and make a dip in the centre. Break in the egg, then prick the yolk with the tip of a sharp knife.

STEP 2
Cover the bowl with its lid or clingfilm. Microwave on high for 1 min, and then in 20 sec bursts until the white is set. Scatter over the coriander and serve with the warmed pitta.
