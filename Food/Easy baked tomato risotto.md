Meals x 2

Ingredients:
25g butter
1 onion, chopped
3 garlic cloves, crushed
300g risotto rice
1 vegetable or chicken stock cube, or use 700ml fresh stock
400g can cherry tomatoes
50g parmesan or vegetarian alternative, grated
small handful of basil, leaves picked

Method:
STEP 1
Before you get started, take a look at our weighing and measuring skills guide. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Melt the butter in a large ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat and fry the onion for 3-4 mins until starting to soften. Add the garlic and cook for another minute, stirring the whole time. Tip in the rice and mix well to coat in the buttery onion mixture.

STEP 2
If you’re using a stock cube, boil the kettle. Crumble the stock cube into a jug and carefully measure in 700ml hot water from the kettle, stirring to dissolve the cube. If using fresh stock, warm this in a pan over a low heat until steaming.

STEP 3
Add the cherry tomatoes and hot stock to the rice, season with salt and pepper and stir to combine.

STEP 4
Cover with a tightly fitting lid and bake for 20 mins. Carefully remove from the oven using oven gloves and stir – the rice should be just cooked, with a little bite. The risotto may still look quite runny at this stage.

STEP 5
Stir through most of the cheese, replace the lid and leave to stand for 3-4 mins. Sprinkle with the rest of the cheese and the basil to serve.
