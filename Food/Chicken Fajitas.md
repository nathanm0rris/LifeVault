Meals x 2

Ingredients:
2 large chicken breasts, finely sliced
1 red onion, finely sliced
1 red pepper, sliced
1 red chilli, finely sliced (optional)
For the marinade
1 heaped tbsp smoked paprika
1 tbsp ground coriander
pinch of ground cumin
2 medium garlic cloves, crushed
4 tbsp olive oil
1 lime, juiced
4-5 drops Tabasco

Method:
STEP 1
Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and wrap 6 medium tortillas in foil.

STEP 2
Mix 1 heaped tbsp smoked paprika, 1 tbsp ground coriander, a pinch of ground cumin, 2 crushed garlic cloves, 4 tbsp olive oil, the juice of 1 lime and 4-5 drops Tabasco together in a bowl with a big pinch each of salt and pepper.

STEP 3
Stir 2 finely sliced chicken breasts, 1 finely sliced red onion, 1 sliced red pepper and 1 finely sliced red chilli, if using, into the marinade.

STEP 4
Heat a griddle pan until smoking hot and add the chicken and marinade to the pan.

STEP 5
Keep everything moving over a high heat for about 5 mins using tongs until you get a nice charred effect. If your griddle pan is small you may need to do this in two batches.

STEP 6
To check the chicken is cooked, find the thickest part and tear in half â€“ if any part is still raw cook until done.

STEP 7
Put the tortillas in the oven to heat up and serve with the cooked chicken, a bag of mixed salad and one 230g tub of fresh salsa.
