Heat the butter and oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat until foaming. Squeeze large chunks of the sausagemeat out of the skins and into the pan. Cook for 5-8 mins or until golden brown. Add the mushrooms and cook for a further 5 mins until starting to turn brown. Stir through the paprika and cook for 1 min before stirring in the soured cream, mustard and stock.
