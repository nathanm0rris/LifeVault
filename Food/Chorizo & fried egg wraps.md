Meals x 2

Ingredients:
4 small cooking chorizo , halved lengthways
4 eggs
2 tbsp mayonnaise
4 flatbreads
4 handfuls rocket
1 tbsp capers , drained

Method:
STEP 1
Put the chorizo into a cold frying pan over a low heat, then gradually increase it. Fry until cooked through and beginning to crisp.

STEP 2
Lift the chorizo out of the pan, leaving behind just enough oil to stop the eggs sticking. Crack the eggs into the pan and fry them how you like them (an almost-set yolk is best if you want to avoid any drips!).

STEP 3
Spread some mayo over each flatbread, add a handful of the rocket and a few capers with two halves of chorizo to each. Put the egg on top, then fold up the end and the two sides before tucking in.
