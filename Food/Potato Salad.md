Meals x 2

Ingredients:
800g small new potato
3 shallots, finely chopped
3 tbsp mayonnaise, or to taste
3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
1 tbsp white wine vinegar
small handful parsley leaves, roughly chopped

Method:
STEP 1
Boil the potatoes in salted water for 20 mins until just cooked, drain, then cool.

STEP 2
Cut the potatoes into chunks, then throw into a bowl with the shallots, capers and cornichons, if using. Add enough mayonnaise to bind, then mix together the olive oil and vinegar and add just enough to give a little sharpness to the salad. Stir in the finely chopped parsley and serve.
